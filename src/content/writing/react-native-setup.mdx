React Native is an open-source framework created by Facebook, which is used to develop mobile apps using JavaScript and React. In this article, we will learn how to start with React Native development on Linux by installing all the necessary tools. At the end of the article, you will have a bare-bones “Hello world” React Native application running on your system.

I will primarily be using Arch Linux for this guide, but whenever necessary, I will also provide instructions for other popular Linux distributions such as Fedora and Ubuntu.

We will require these 4 tools for setting up the developer environment for React Native:

1. Node JS
2. Java OpenJDK
3. Android Studio
4. Visual Studio Code

## Installing and Setting up NodeJS

To manage Node.js versions, we’ll be using Node Version Manager (NVM), which is compatible with any Linux distribution. NVM offers the flexibility to install and switch between multiple Node.js versions on our system, enabling us to work with different projects that require specific versions of Node.js. You can learn more about NVM [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

**Steps for installing and setting up NodeJs using NVM:**

Open [this link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to download NVM. You will get the script to download and install NVM, or just copy and paste the command below into your terminal.

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-nvm.sh"
  code={`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`}
/>

After downloading NVM, refresh your Bash session with the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="refresh-bash.sh"
  code={`bash`}
/>

Run the following command to verify the NVM installation:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="verify-nvm.sh"
  code={`nvm --version`}
/>

We’re now ready to install Node.js using NVM, and we’ll be installing the Long-Term Support (LTS) version. To do so, execute the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-node.sh"
  code={`nvm install --lts`}
/>

Again, refresh your Bash session with the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="refresh-bash.sh"
  code={`bash`}
/>

Verify your Node.js installation using the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="verify-node.sh"
  code={`node -v`}
/>

## Installing and Setting up Java OpenJDK

### To install Java OpenJDK, use the following commands:

- For Arch and Arch-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-java-arch.sh"
  code={`sudo pacman -S jdk11-openjdk`}
/>

For more info, check the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/java).

- For Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-java-ubuntu.sh"
  code={`sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`}
/>

For more info, check [help.ubuntu.com/community/Java](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java).

- For Fedora and Fedora-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-java-fedora.sh"
  code={`sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk.x86_64`}
/>

For more info, check [docs.fedoraproject.org](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-java/).

### Adding JAVA_HOME environment variable in bashrc

To add the JAVA_HOME environment variable, edit the `.bashrc` file located in the home directory (which is a hidden file). Simply copy and paste the following content to add the JAVA_HOME variable in `.bashrc`.

- For Arch and Arch-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename=".bashrc"
  code={`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/`}
/>

- For Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename=".bashrc"
  code={`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`}
/>

- For Fedora and Fedora-based Linux distros:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename=".bashrc"
  code={`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-11-openjdk`}
/>

## Installing and Setting up Visual Studio Code

I would recommend using VSCodium, which is functionally identical to VSCode but is a free and open-source alternative.

- For Arch and Arch-based Linux distros:

To install [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), we’ll use the following command to download it from the AUR (Arch User Repository) on Arch Linux:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-arch.sh"
  code={`yay -S vscodium-bin`}
/>

- For Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Linux distros, use the following commands:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-ubuntu.sh"
  code={`wget -qO - https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/raw/master/pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-ubuntu.sh"
  code={`echo 'deb [ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/vscodium-archive-keyring.gpg ] https://download.vscodium.com/debs vscodium main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscodium.list`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-ubuntu.sh"
  code={`sudo apt update && sudo apt install codium`}
/>

- For Fedora and Fedora-based Linux distros, use the following commands:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-fedora.sh"
  code={`sudo rpmkeys --import https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/-/raw/master/pub.gpg`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-fedora.sh"
  code={`printf "[gitlab.com_paulcarroty_vscodium_repo]\nname=download.vscodium.com\nbaseurl=https://download.vscodium.com/rpms/\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\nrepo_gpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://gitlab.com/paulcarroty/vscodium-deb-rpm-repo/-/raw/master/pub.gpg\nmetadata_expire=1h" | sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/vscodium.repo`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-vscodium-fedora.sh"
  code={`sudo dnf install codium`}
/>

## Installing and Setting up Android Studio

### Install Android Studio

1. **Installing Android Studio (on any Linux distro)**

- Download the Android Studio tar file from the [Android Studio official site](https://developer.android.com/studio), and then extract it using your preferred method.

- Once extracted, go inside its `bin` folder and run the `studio.sh`.

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="run-android-studio.sh"
  code={`./studio.sh`}
/>

2. **Installing Android Studio on Arch and Arch-based distros**

For Arch Linux and its derivatives, an AUR package is also available which can be downloaded using the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="install-android-studio-arch.sh"
  code={`yay -S android-studio`}
/>

### Adding the necessary paths in bashrc for proper working of Android Studio

To ensure the proper functioning of Android Studio, we need to add the necessary paths to the `.bashrc` file. Copy and paste the following content into your `.bashrc` file.

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename=".bashrc"
  code={`export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools`}
/>

### Adding an Android device for testing our React Native application

For setting up an Android device, there are two ways:

1. **Using a physical device** by connecting to the computer using a USB cable.

To test your React Native application on a physical device, connect your Android device to your PC using a USB cable. Ensure that USB debugging is enabled in your Android device’s developer options, and select file transfer mode for the USB connection.

2. **Creating a virtual device in Android Studio**. For a more detailed guide on creating virtual devices in Android Studio, you can refer to the [official guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html).

- Open Android Studio, click on “More Action,” then click “Virtual Device Manager.”

![Virtual Device Manager in Android Studio](https://pratik280.github.io/assets/03-setting-up-your-react-native-development-environment-on-linux-a-comprehensive-guide/virtual-device-manager.png.webp)

- Select a device that has the Google Play icon in the Play Store column.

![Selecting Android Virtual Device in Android Studio](https://pratik280.github.io/assets/03-setting-up-your-react-native-development-environment-on-linux-a-comprehensive-guide/avd.png.webp)

- Click on the play icon to launch the AVD.

- If the emulator doesn’t launch or terminates instantly, you can launch it from the terminal to see the logs and diagnose any issues. In my case, the emulator failed to launch due to a missing `libpulse` library, which I resolved by downloading it.

Navigate to your Android folder, which for me is located at `~/Android/Sdk`, to start the emulator from the terminal.

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="navigate-android-sdk.sh"
  code={`cd ~/Android/Sdk/emulator`}
/>

Run this command to list the AVDs:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="list-avds.sh"
  code={`./emulator -list-avds`}
/>

Then run this command to start the AVD:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="start-avd.sh"
  code={`./emulator @<AVD_NAME>
./emulator @Pixel_4_API_33`}
/>

## Starting with React Native

To ensure everything is working, we will create a simple HelloWorld project in React Native.

Create a React Native project by executing the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="create-react-native-project.sh"
  code={`npx react-native init <ProjectName>`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="create-react-native-project.sh"
  code={`npx react-native init Hello
cd Hello`}
/>

Open the “Hello” folder in VSCodium/VSCode.

Open two separate terminals in the same folder and run these two commands:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="start-react-native.sh"
  code={`npx react-native start`}
/>

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  filename="run-android.sh"
  code={`npm run android`}
/>

You will see the application running on your Android device.

> I recommend installing the “ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets” extension by the publisher “dsznajder” in VSCodium/VSCode. This extension provides snippets that enable you to generate React Native components quickly and easily.

In VSCodium/VSCode, open the `App.tsx` file and delete its contents to start fresh. Type `rnfes`, and VSCode will automatically suggest the snippet from the extension we installed earlier. This snippet will create a simple component for us.

<CodeBlock
  language="jsx"
  filename="App.tsx"
  code={`import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({});`}
/>

Once you save the file, the application will display a simple ‘Hello’ message.
